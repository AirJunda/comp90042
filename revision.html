  <h3>COMP90042: Revision Materials</h3>
</div>

<p>
Here are some materials to assist with your revision. Please ensure you make an attempt at the questions before looking at the
answers. This is a more effective way to study for retaining ideas and building your knowledge than simply studying  the
answers directly.
</p>

<p>
Note that the topics covered have changed somewhat from previous years, so not all questions will be relevant.
