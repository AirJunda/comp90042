  <h3>COMP90042 Web Search and Text Analysis</h3>
</div>

The aims for this subject is for students to develop an understanding of the main algorithms used in natural language processing and text retrieval, for use in a diverse range of
applications including text classification, information retrieval, machine translation, and question answering. Topics to be
covered include vector space models, part-of-speech tagging, n-gram language
modelling, syntactic parsing and neural sequence models. The programming language used is Python, see <a href="python.html">the
detailed configuration instructions</a> for more information on its use in the workshops, assignments and
installation at home.

<p> Also feel free to post your questions, preferably to the discussion forum in the LMS, or else
by e-mail (<a href="mailto:initial.last@unimelb.edu.au">initial.last@unimelb.edu.au</a>). 
Please address emails to both Trevor Cohn and Daniel Beck, using the TO or CC field.
Whatever you do, please don't send us both copies of the same email individually, as this just wastes our time.
Don't expect an immediate response to emails. 
We aim to get back to you within a business day or two.
